const express = require('express');
  const app = express();
  const port = 3000;
  
This code sets up a basic Express server that listens on port 3000 and responds with "Hello, World!" when someone accesses the root URL. 
You can expand and customize this code to build more complex applications by adding additional routes, middleware, 
and functionality as needed.
